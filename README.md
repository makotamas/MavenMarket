# MavenMarket (PowerBI)

I utilized a fictitious webshop's dataset named "MavenMarket", containing more than 200,000-row data sources. During this project I tried to explore as much PowerBI functionalities as I could and practise. The project includes:

- **8 tables** - 2 facts, 5 dimensions, 1 measure

- **26 explicit measures**

- **17 visualizations**

- **3 pages**
